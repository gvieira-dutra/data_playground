This folder is from the course 'Power BI Data Dashboards' I am currently persuing on LinkedIn Learning.
I have been facing some challenges due to Power BI limitations in sharing my work so others can see what I've been doing, the work around I have now is to export all as pdf the caveat is that the filter will not be clickable. 
You may also download the .pbix file and the Data Sources folder and you should be able to see this work in your computer (Will probably need to fix the path to the data source files).
Cheers!
